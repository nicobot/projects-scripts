# Projects-Scripts
This is a base project that aims to easily create a structure for holding projects and creating them in a quick way.

An example of how to use it would be:

```new-project drupal8-test```

And that would create a drupal boilerplate, based on the repository: https://github.com/nicobot/drupal-project-boilerplate

# Requirements

It is recommended to install smartcd (https://github.com/cxreg/smartcd) so all binaries will be accesible from the projects-scripts folder.

Binaries will be created and uploaded when needed/implemented.
